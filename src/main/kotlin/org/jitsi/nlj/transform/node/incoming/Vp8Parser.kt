 * Some [Vp8Packet] fields are not able to be determined by looking at a single VP8 packet (for example the spatial
 * layer index can only be acquired from keyframes).  This class keeps a longer-running 'memory' of the information
 * needed to fill out fields like that in [Vp8Packet]s
 *
 * TODO(brian): This class shouldn't really be a [ModifierNode], but since we put it in-line in the video
 * receive pipeline (as opposed to demuxing based on payload type and routing only known VP8 packets to
 * it), it's the most appropriate node type for now.
