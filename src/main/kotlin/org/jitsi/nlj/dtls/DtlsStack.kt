/**
 * Represents a single instance of a DTLS stack for a given connection.  This class also acts as the [DatagramTransport]
 * used by the underlying DTLS library in order to send and receive DTLS packets.  Users of this class need to handle
 * passing incoming DTLS packets into the stack, as well as handling packets the stack wants to send out.  The passing
 * of incoming packets is done via calling [processIncomingDtlsPackets].  The handling of outgoing packets is done by
 * assigning a handler to the [onOutgoingProtocolData] member.  Incoming packets may be either control packets
 * (terminated by the stack itself) or app packets which have been sent over DTLS (SCTP packets, for example).  After
 * passing incoming packets to the stack via [processIncomingDtlsPackets], any app packets ready for further processing
 * will be returned.  Outgoing packets can be sent via [sendDtlsAppData].
 *
 * An example of passing incoming DTLS packets through the stack:
 *
 *  --> Recv 'dtlsPacket' from the network and pass it into the stack:
 *  val appPackets = dtlsStack.processIncomingDtlsPackets(listOf(dtlsPacket))
 *  if (appPackets.isNotEmpty()) {
 *    // Process the app packets
 *  }
 *
 *  An example of sending app packets out via the DTLS stack:
 *  dtlsStack.onOutgoingData = { outgoingDtlsPacket ->
 *    // Work to send the packets out
 *  }
 *  val dtlsAppPacket = ...
 *  dtlsStack.sendDtlsAppData(dtlsAppPacket)
